# Wordle Image Parser
This is a image parser developed in Python that uses the Pytesseract and OpenCV libraries to extract game information from a given Wordle screenshot.
The motivation behind this project was a problem stemming from another Wordle-related project, which required the classification of a large library of Wordle screenshots by their scores.
To manually classify each screenshot would be tedious and impractical in the long term, so this project came to be as a way to automate the otherwise manual classification process.

## Requirements
This project requires the installation of TesseractOCR. During development, TesseractOCR was installed using
a [pre-built binary package](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html), but should be able to work if TesseractOCR was [built from source](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html). More specifics on how to configure Tesseract for the program can be found below.
